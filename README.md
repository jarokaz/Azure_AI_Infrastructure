# Azure AI Infrastructure - running AI workloads at scale workshop

Azure AI infrastructure provides virtually limitless scale to train and operationalize the largest machine learning models. In this workshop, we focus on training and operationalizing large scale deep learning models. The key technologies covered during the workshop are Azure GPU VMs, Azure Batch AI, and Azure Machine Learning Model Management. Through hands-on labs and instructor led walkthroughs the attendees will master the following scenarios:

-  Parallel training using multi GPU VMs 
-  Distributed training on clusters of GPU VMs
-  Cloud deployment & management of machine learning models
 
 A typical agenda goes as follows:
* Introductions
* Azure Cloud AI Platform Overview
* Hands-on Labs
  * Lab 0 - Environment set up
  * Lab 1 - Single GPU training
  * Lab 2 - Parallel training on a multi GPU VM 
  * Lab 3 - Distributed training on a cluster of GPU VMs 
  * Lab 4 - Model operationalization on Azure Kubernetis Server
  * Lab 5 - Model operationalizetion on Azure FPGA service
