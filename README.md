# Azure AI Infrastructure - running AI workloads at scale workshop

Azure AI infrastructure provides virtually limitless scale to train and operationalize the largest machine learning models. In this workshop, we will focus on Azure AI compute services including GPU VMs, GPU clusters, and Azure Container Services. Through hands-on labs and instructor led walkthroughs the attendees will master the following scenarios:
-  Single GPU Node  Model Training
-  Parallel training using multi GPU VMs 
-  Distributed training on clusters of GPU VMs
-  Cloud model deployment & management using Azure Machine Learning Model Management
-  Edge model deployment to IoT Edge and other edge platforms 

When run in a classroom setting a typical agenda goes as follows:
* Introductions
* Azure Cloud AI Platform Overview
* Hands-on Labs
  * Lab 1 - Warm-up - Single GPU training
  * Lab 2 - Parallel training on multi GPU VMs
  * Lab 3 - Distributed training using **asynchronous SGD** and parameter server architecture
  * Lab 4 - Distributed training using **synchronous Allreduce** approach
